#crossref
This is for parts crossreference specific to the Toyobaru Triplets(BRZ/FR-S/86)

#Reason for this
Pissed off at how aftermarket/OEM manufactures part names rarely ever match with the service manuals. OEM is the worst, the part name in the service manuals rarely ever match with the part name provided by the OEM part website(s).

#Who this will help
Mostly myself... But I do hope that this will save someone out there the frustration and hours of research that I myself have gone through to find parts. It's absolutely rediculous to put people through hours of hell just to find an over priced(oem) bolt.

#Going the Extra Mile
Include specs of each part (especially nuts and bolts) torque specs, part numbers, substitutions for unavailable parts, crossref from oem to aftermarket parts against the service manual part names with page reference and many other things.

#Frequence of Updates
This is will be updated as I work on my triplet, so if "you the reader" want to add something please make a pull request and hopefully we can help each other :)
